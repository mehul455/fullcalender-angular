// This was the easiest way to deliver FullCalendar's CSS without forcing the dev to
// include each plugins' stylesheet or write a custom angular builder. The fullcalenedar-scheduler
// stylesheet includes the CSS for ALL plugins, but it's not that big.
//
// The need for this arose out of the fact that angular does not handle arbitrary imports of CSS files
// from JS files. Unfortunately, this is how FullCalendar's plugin system works.
